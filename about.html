	<h2><p style="font-family:'Courier New'">what is this?</p></h2>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">This is a place where people can gather over shared dislike of  words and phrases. 
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Language is everywhere. We eat it up every day, sometimes without thinking. Maybe we can look closer and be more critical.</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">All words except hate speech and the like are welcome, and in any language. No word is safe!</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Just share why you donâ€™t like it and translate it.</p>
		<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">If you want to add more to your word submission, send  a message. This site is VERY flexible.</p>
