	<h3 style="text-align:center;">This is an internet art project where people can not only submit euphemisms and translations, but also find connections between words and connect with each other.
	The connected discord server is for open discussion surrounding euphemistic language. feel free to start/join conversations there or send a private <a href="messages.html">message.</a>  
	The project developed out of personal interest in language and net art. It is connected to a thesis from a university student studying digital media and culture. It will change as more people contribute to it.</h3>

	<h3 style="text-align:center;">Vague language is everywhere. Let's <a href="https://discord.gg/fqXkDjRnnJ">talk about it.</a> <img src="rotating_smiley_gifcities.org.gif"> (this link will take you to discord)</h3> 
	<h3 style="text-align:center;">If you want to add more to your word submission (art, audio, etc.), send a message or <a href="https://github.com/jamienorthman/full-exposure">contribute directly to the open source code on the platform github.</a></h3>
