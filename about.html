	<p style="font-family:'Courier New';"><em>this is an internet art project where people can not only submit euphemisms and translations, but also find connections between words and connect with each other.
	maybe net art can encourage us to be more critical about euphemistic language and more reflective about the way we communicate. the project was conceived and is currently overseen by a university student studying media and culture. it will change as more people contribute to it.</em></p>

	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">vague language is everywhere. let's <a href="https://discord.gg/fqXkDjRnnJ">talk about it.</a><img src="rotating_smiley_gifcities.org.gif">(that's the discord server)</p> 
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">if you want to add more to your word submission (art, audio, etc.), send a message or <a href="https://github.com/jamienorthman/full-exposure">contribute code on github.</a></p>
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">no word is safe!</p>
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; font-weight:bold">why are some words links?</p>
	<p style="font-family:'Courier New'">just for extra context. some euphemisms are less known than others.</p>
